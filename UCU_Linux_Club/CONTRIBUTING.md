# For mentors
Please, don\`t commit directly to the repo, especially if you are implementing some feature that needs to be tested and checked, such as a manual or some interesting code. Instead of that, make a branch with a feature name, test everything and only then merge branches
# For external developers
If you want to make a contribution in such a useful project, you can make it in a few ways:
- open an **Issue** and describe, what do you think about materials, schedule etc, what we can do better (in your opinion), just give a feedback.
- fork, make changes and create a PR
## What help do we need?
- suggestions for next semester & future in general
- better presentations format
- translation of all materials to English
- interesting tasks for lessons
- interesting and **useful** hometasks
